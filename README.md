# scalajs-pointer-events-polyfill

A Scala.js facade for [Pointer Events Polyfill version 0.4.1](https://github.com/jquery/PEP/tree/0.4.1).
[Pointer Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events) provide
a common interface for handling different pointing devices (mouse, touch, pen, etc.).
They're not supported by many browsers yet, hence the need for a polyfill.
